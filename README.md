# Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. The main operations on a queue are:

**Enqueue:** Adds an element to the rear of the queue.

**Dequeue:** Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.

**Front:** Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.

**isEmpty:** Checks if the queue is empty.
